abstract: Pions constitute nearly 70% of final state particles in ultra high
  energy collisions. They act as a probe to understand the statistical
  properties of Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) matter i.e. Quark Gluon Plasma
  (QGP) created in such relativistic heavy ion collisions (HIC). Apart from
  this, direct photons are the most versatile tools to study relativistic HIC.
  They are produced, by various mechanisms, during the entire space-time history
  of the strongly interacting system. Direct photons provide measure of
  jet-quenching when compared with other quark or gluon jets. The Ï€0 decay into
  two photons make the identification of non-correlated gamma coming from
  another process cumbersome in the Electromagnetic Calorimeter. We investigate
  the use of deep learning architecture for reconstruction and identification of
  single as well as multi particles showers produced in calorimeter by particles
  created in high energy collisions. We utilize the data of electromagnetic
  shower at calorimeter cell-level to train the network and show improvements
  for identification and characterization. These networks are fast and
  computationally inexpensive for particle shower identification and
  reconstruction for current and future experiments at particle colliders.
