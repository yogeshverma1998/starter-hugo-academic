summary: Muons are the most abundant charged particles arriving at sea level
  originating from the decay of secondary charged pions and kaons. These
  secondary particles are created when high-energy cosmic rays hit the
  atmosphere interacting with air nuclei initiating cascades of secondary
  particles which led to the formation of extensive air showers (EAS). They
  carry essential information about the extra-terrestrial events and are
  characterized by large flux and varying angular distribution. To account for
  open questions and the origin of cosmic rays, one needs to study various
  components of cosmic rays with energy and arriving direction. Because of the
  close relation between muon and neutrino production, it is the most important
  particle to keep track of. We propose a novel tracking algorithm based on the
  Geometric Deep Learning approach using graphical structure to incorporate
  domain knowledge to track cosmic ray muons in our 3-D scintillator detector.
  The detector is modeled using the GEANT4 simulation package and EAS is
  simulated using CORSIKA (COsmic Ray SImulations for KAscade) with a focus on
  muons originating from EAS. We shed some light on the performance, robustness
  towards noise and double hits, limitations, and application of the proposed
  algorithm in tracking applications with the possibility to generalize to other
  detectors for astrophysical and collider experiments.
