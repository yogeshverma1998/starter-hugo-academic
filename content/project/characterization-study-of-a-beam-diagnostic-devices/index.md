Performed a characteristic study of Beam Diagnostic devices including Beam Position Monitors (BPMs) and FFCs. Developed a novel automation method for calibration and characterization of beam position monitors (BPM). The automation method developed is to be implemented in Free Electron Laser (FEL) setup in IUAC. Earned first authorship on subsequent publication of this work in IBIC-2020.
