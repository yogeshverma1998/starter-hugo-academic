Researched the spatial and temporal nature of shower shapes of polarized particles in 3D & 2D Calorimeter using GEANT4. Analysed complex spatial data to recognise features for building machine learning models
. Developed Machine learning models using python and tensorflow for classification of particles on basis of shower shapes
