title: Jet characterization in Heavy Ion Collisions by QCD-Aware Graph Neural Networks
date: 2021-04-01T13:56:00.979Z
summary: The identification of jets and their constituents is one of the key
  problems and challenging task in heavy ion experiments such as experiments at
  RHIC and LHC. The presence of huge background of soft particles pose a curse
  for jet finding techniques. The inabilities or lack of efficient techniques to
  filter out the background lead to a fake or combinatorial jet formation which
  may have an errorneous interpretation. In this article, we present Graph
  Reduction technique (GraphRed), a novel class of physics-aware and
  topology-based attention graph neural network built upon jet physics in heavy
  ion collisions. This approach directly works with the physical observables of
  variable-length set of final state particles on an event-by-event basis to
  find most likely jet-induced particles in an event. This technique demonstrate
  the robustness and applicability of this method for finding jet-induced
  particles and show that graph architectures are more efficient than previous
  frameworks. This technique exhibit foremost time a classifier working on
  particle-level in each heavy ion event produced at the LHC. We present the
  applicability and integration of the model with current jet finding algorithms
  such as FastJet.

The identification of jets and their constituents is one of the key problems and challenging task in heavy ion experiments such as experiments at RHIC and LHC. The presence of huge background of soft particles pose a curse for jet finding techniques.

This approach directly works with the physical observables of variable-length set of final state particles on an event-by-event basis to find most likely jet-induced particles in an event.
